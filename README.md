# Webspicy

A specification and test framework for web services seen as black-box software
operations. Webspicy yields a better test coverage for a smaller testing effort.

See webspicy in action and make the tutorial on https://yourbackendisbroken.dev

Have a look at `doc/*.md` for vocabulary and vision as well as `ROADMAP.md`.

## Features

* Declarative specification of HTTP web services + their tests

* Framework/language agnostic: `webspicy` is written in Ruby, but can be used
  to test web services for backends written in any language / framework.

* Black box testing: `webspicy` focuses on web services seen as blackboxes. It
  has no knowledge of the implementation, and focuses on HTTP and input/output
  data instead. Investing in such testing makes those tests more stable and
  your API design better.

* Formal and human-friendly data schema with strong data matching semantics,
  thanks to [http://finitio.io](http://finitio.io)

* Test instrumentation and generation, based on PRE & POST contracts.

* Extra goodness for Rubyists: being written in ruby, `webspicy` also supports
  testing Rack applications directly (through rack/test), which boosts the
  test suite.

* Extra goodies: when a specification is written, it can also be used for
  mocking the API, generating an openapi file, etc.

## Is this used on real-world cases?

Yes, `webspicy` is currently used on a dozen production components. Our biggest specification has 324 specification files for thousands of tests, 35% of them being generated.

## Getting started with the commandline

To install webspicy on your developer computer, install ruby then:

```
gem install webspicy
```

Then execute webspicy help to see the options.

```
webspicy --help
```

## Using the docker image(s)

If you just want to play with the commandline tool without having to
install ruby & webspicy, you can use the docker image we provide for
the commandline:

```
docker run enspirit/webspicy --help
```

If you have a specification & test suite somewhere, an easy way to run the
whole suite (or integrate it in your continuous integration pipeline) is
to use our `:tester` docker image. Just mount your test suite as a volume
in `/home/app` and you are good to go:

```
docker run -v path/to/tests:/formalspec enspirit/webspicy:tester
```

If your plan is to test a backend that runs on your own machine (vs.
publicly on the Internet or inside the default docker network),
you will need to add some networking option, as shown below. Please
refer to Docker documentation.

```
docker run -v path/to/tests:/formalspec --network=host enspirit/webspicy:tester
```
